<h1>Delete User Account</h1>

<p>
    <!-- I'm explaining clearly what this page does -->
    This is a secure place for Admin to remove a user account from the system.
    This deletes the account from the SQLite users table only — the patient MongoDB records stays the same.
    Please double-check the username before you press delete because this action cannot be undone.
</p>

<form method="POST">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

    <div>
        <!-- I'm showing the field where the admin types the username to delete -->
        {{ form.username.label }}<br>
        {{ form.username(size=40) }}
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
        <!-- I'm rendering the delete button -->
        {{ form.submit() }}
    </div>
</form>
